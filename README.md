# Character Sheet (D&D 5e)
This app allows you to store your D&D 5e Character Sheet in your device.
It uses Local Storage, so it won't persist between different devices.

# Extra Utilities

## Import / Export (IN PROGRESS)
A tool will allow you to export your character sheet so you can import it in another device.
This will prevent you from having to type all the information again when you swap devices.
